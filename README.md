# Eyecare Reminder

Simple app that sends a notification as a reminder to look away from the screen far into the distance.  
The purpose is to exercise the eye muscles as myopia (nearsightedness) is increasingly  
developed amongst people looking at screens for a prolonged amount of time every day.  
Exercising the muscles may help prevent or slow down the progression of myopia.

Reminder interval as well as how long you should look away are configurable.  
In addition, you can also add application or window names, and you will not be disturbed if they are running.

Currently, notifications will not be sent if:  

* The system is idle.
* The microphone is active (configurable on/off).
* Blacklisted application or window is running (configurable).

Tested only on X11, Xubuntu 20.04 LTS and pulseaudio.   
It is likely it will not work on Wayland or PipeWire.

## Installing

_**Ubuntu 20.04**_  
<font size="1">_(Newer versions will not work as they use Wayland)_</font>
```commandline
add-apt-repository ppa:lyubo-angelov/eyecare-reminder
apt-get update
apt install python3-eyecare-reminder
```

### Dependencies
<font size="2">_(should automatically install with package)_</font>
```
python3-pyqt5
python3-yaml
python3-psutil
python3-jeepney
python3-xdg
x11-utils
pulseaudio-utils
xprintidle
```

## Usage

Upon launching, a system tray icon will be added.  
Clicking it should bring up a menu with a few options.

* _**Edit config**_ - opens the config file with the default text editing application set on the system.
* _**Reload config**_ - reloads the config file. Must be run after editing config to pick up new changes.
* _**Open log**_ - opens the log with the default text editing application set on the system.
* _**Reset to default**_ - reset the config file to default.  
* _**Autostart**_ - Enable/Disable autostart on login, _**only works on Gnome**_.
* _**Exit**_ - exits the app.

The default settings are set to bring up a notification every 20 mins,  
with 2 minutes of looking into the distance after which another notification is brought up    
to signify that looking at the screen may be resumed.

### Config file

* _**enable_sound**_ - "true" or "false". Enables or disables the sound of the notifications.
* _**suppress_when_microphone_active**_ - "true" or "false". Whether to ignore notifications when microphone is active.
* _**idle_time**_ - number of seconds after which system is considered idle.
* _**reminder_interval**_ - number of seconds after which the reminder notification is sent.
* _**reminder_cooldown_interval**_ - number of seconds to look into the distance. 2nd notification appears after this.
* _**blacklist_process_names**_ - eg. ["process_name1", "process_name2"] Ignore notifications if these are running.
* _**blacklist_window_names**_ - eg. ["window1", "window2"] Ignore notifications if any of these windows are open.
